    "**Food-Ez** is a new food delivery service specializing in delivering food in small, walkable cities. Like other companies like DoorDash and UberEats, Food-Ez is a three sided marketplace, dealing with the needs and wants of customers (those who place the orders), restaurants (those who create the orders), and deliverers (those who fulfill the orders). Understanding this, Food-Ez developed a novel dispatch algorithm to maximize efficiency in their marketplace. Specifically, they created an algorithm that minimized delivery time by matching orders to drivers closest to the restaurant. While this approach has been effective for Food-Ez, they are looking to upgrade their current algorithm in a few ways. First, they are **allowing deliverers to be assigned up to 2 orders at a time**. Second, they want to have more efficient operations. Their current algorithm has drivers waiting quite a bit of time for food to be prepped at restaurants. They want to **maximize deliverer efficiency by minimizing driver wait and idle time**. "

    "The first question can be answered by understanding the business objective. We want customers to utilize our service for their food delivery needs. We promote our service by promising fast and accurate delivery right to their doors. Additionally, since our drivers are critical to the operations of this business, we want to keep our drivers as busy as possible to ensure they maximize earnings. Essentially, our business objective is to maintain optimal customer service to those who order while also providing good opportunities to our deliverers to make money. How can we optimize for both objectives simultaneously? Or rather, what system are we trying to control to fulfill this objective? **The system we are aiming to control for Food-Ez is the queue**. If we can control the queue (i.e. drive the queue to zero), customers orders will be assigned quickly and be delivered quickly. Subsequently, if the queue is managed correctly, drivers' objective of maximizing earnings will also be optimized. The queue is the system for which we will be designing a controller."

We now need to implement actions that optimize the system's efficiency. In the previous section(s), we have identified the key objective. We need to assign orders to drivers such that orders get to their locations ASAP while also providing enough work to the drivers. There are several approaches to address this problem and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. We could implement logic such that we always assign the closest driver the order that comes in. Another approach would be holding orders for longer in the queue to see if a more \"optimally\" positioned driver comes along to take multiple orders nearby. We need sound strategy to identify which algorithmic process we should implement. For Food-Ez, it is optimizing the queue such that we minimize delivery time and maximize driver utilization (i.e. minimize driver idle time). Therefore, we need to design a controller that will balance these two objectives. "

In the context of food delivery, this essentially means every order can only have one driver and every driver can only have one order.

Converting this to hours, a deliverer can now fulfill 3 orders per hour, thus changing our deliverer utilization rate from 50% to 33%. More importantly, the queue wait time decreases from 30 minutes to 10 minutes (average queue length in this scenario is ~.167 orders, which is then divided by 1 order per hour).

Once implemented, we can substitute the current dispatch algorithm for the newly enhanced one and it should fit into our control design seamlessly.

We ran 5 simulations for 120 iterations (120 simulation \"minutes\"). The simulation parameters consist of the following: number of drivers (which we hold constant throughout), number of restaurants, grid size of city, order arrival rate, route time weight, wait time weight, driver acceptance weight, and driver idleness weight.

    "From @tbl-res-1, the number of deliveries performed appear to be consistent even with the change of parameter weights. This is a nice observation since simulation 2 had half of the drivers that the other simulations had, but delivered the most orders. Furthermore, simulation 2 shows that drivers were used efficiently as most drivers were only idle for on about 3 minutes on average, compared to the other simulations that had far more idle time. We continue to see this trend in other metrics for simulation 2. Simulation 2 had the lowest average time to dropoff, lowest average time of total route, and even lowest pending time for orders in the queue. Further investigation is needed to see what the optimal driver supply would be in different scenarios, but this is a telling sign at the moment that our new algorithm utilizes driver supply more efficiently."
