    "Welcome to my blog! If you are reading this, I hope that means you are as excited about learning statistics as I am about teaching it (and continuing to learn it!). This blog, honestly, is mostly a tool for me to improve my own knowledge in statistics by learning how I would convey it to others. I plan on doing this from a data analysis perspective. Given a certain situation/set of data points, how do we construct the problems we want to solve and implement proper solutions. Particularly, I hope to demonstrate that Bayesian methods can be viable methods to solve problems in business, healthcare, etc. Anyways, I hope you find this blog interesting and useful in your data career. Whether you are just entering data or are an experienced data professional, this blog intends to be a resource in demonstrating good data analysis with sound applied mathematical theory."
