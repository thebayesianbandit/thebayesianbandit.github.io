Because each member is a host and travel is facilitated through home-swapping, Kindred members only pay for cleaning and platform fees, resulting in significantly lower travel costs.

It encourages users to accurately share their preferences (such as location and travel dates) while simultaneously encouraging hosts to do the same. Through this mutual information sharing, we rank a searcher's preferences against those of hosts. We then return the top option for a searcher, along with a list of other ranked choices. Using these core principles, we can eventually extend this algorithm to become much more sophisticated and capable of handling matching at scale for a platform like Kindred."
