    "Password sharing was a staple of modern video streaming services, particularly when the market was dominated by few players. Now, with many new streaming entrants, account sharing has become a wound in corporate revenue. In this post, we take the perspective of a video streaming company tackling this problem. We analyze account sharing data along with the impact on the company bottom line. We then walk through different ways of amending this problem through strategic frameworks and empirical models. We conclude by discussing how our findings should guide company policy on account usage. "

    "From their perspective, companies like Blockbuster experienced high fixed costs (e.g., physical store locations), with their main stream of revenue coming from newly released movies and late fees. Thus, the shelf life of movies (with regard to lifetime value) was short-lived, as many would rent the new releases, watch them once or twice, forget to return the movie, and Blockbuster would rack up the late fees. What was once an incentive to get valuable inventory back on the shelves turned into the most important line of business for Blockbuster."

    "Reed and Marc decided that there could be a better way to serve the entertainment-seeking public. Instead of designing a business around late fees, physical locations, and the short shelf life of movies, they decided to essentially flip the model. The business would be a centralized warehouse serving subscribers. Instead of customers being tied to a deadline for returning movies, they could keep them for as long as they liked by paying a monthly subscription. This would allow movie lovers to watch multiple movies for a flat monthly fee."

With this move, Netflix became the streaming king, with approximately 200 million subscribers in 2020."

While there were policies in place to limit this sharing (e.g., each plan had a limited number of devices that could be signed into a single account), the general pattern was that one friend or family member would have an account, and each person in their social circle would share access to watch Netflix. This made Netflix even more \"popular\" since it seemed that not only could Netflix deliver top content, but even those who didn't have to pay could access it."

    "Netflix has certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are public-facing and, in a way, determine the company's worth. Metrics like annual revenue and number of customers are generally found in public financial reports and are used to judge whether Netflix is a good company to invest in, thus determining its worth. In addition to these metrics, Netflix has its own internal metrics that guide its decision-making. Some important ones are year-over-year (YoY) growth in different areas like subscribers and revenue. These metrics guide policy decisions to influence company performance. For example, if attrition (customer churn) is high, Netflix may begin researching ways to decrease it. These initiatives are then implemented, and the respective metrics are recorded based on these new company policies. This flow follows the theory behind @fig-control-1. It is an iterative cycle of measuring performance, creating policies to change performance, and measuring that change."
