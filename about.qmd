I love learning and teaching so this blog is my motivation to learn new topics and learn how to best convey the messages I received. I hope to demonstrate in this blog an analytical way to approach problems. I like using a tool-box method in my posts, approaching a problem and demonstrating how various tools can be used to solve it. I hope you enjoy this blog as much as I enjoy writing it!
