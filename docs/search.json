With millions of people using the platform everyday, the company must prioritize resources to understanding their customer base and how to price their product effectively. This analysis is a simple illustration of the power of bayesian pricing methods for rideshare companies. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a basic bayesian linear model at predicting the price of an Uber ride based on our supplied data. Data for this analysis can be found here."

    "section": "Investigating Relationships with Fare Amount",
    "text": "Investigating Relationships with Fare Amount\nAs stated earlier, the purpose of this analysis is to analyze what, if anything, have effects on fare amount. We further this exploration in Figure 2.7 where we check the distribution of fare amount by the passenger count.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Box-and-whisker plots showing the distribution of fare amount by passenger count.\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the distributions among passenger count appear to be approximately the same. The median fare amount for each passenger count appears to be constant and each quartile appears to be relatively equal to the others.\nAnother possible influence could be day of the week when a ride is taken. Figure 2.8 shows the respective distributions of fare amount by weekday and weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Box-and-whisker plot showing distribution of fare amount by weekday vs weekend.\n\n\n\n\nJust as we saw in Figure 2.7, Figure 2.8 shows that there is not much difference between weekday and weekend trips with regard to fare amount.\nAfter having cleaned up our dataset, we can view a scatterplot of trip in miles vs fare amount, colored by weekend or weekday, to see the relationhsip between these variables. This is shown in Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Scatterplot of trip in miles vs fare amount, with each dot colored by weekend (orange) and weekday (blue).\n\n\n\n\nEven after our data cleanup, we see in Figure 2.9 that there is a large amount of data to still use. There appears to be a slight positive linear relationship between trip in miles vs fare amount. We will hope to quantify this when we build our model. There also appears to be a lot more rides during the week vs the weekend (which makes sense since there are more weekdays than weekends)."

We should continue to explore the difference in these different segments. First, we’ll explore the difference in the number of rides by hour, split by weekdays vs weekends. This is shown in Figure 2.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Top panel shows number of rides by hour on weekdays. Bottom panel shows number of rides by hour on weekends.\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, although the total number of rides might differ between weekdays and weekends, the trend appears more or less the same. Weekdays have much heavier peaks around the usual rush hour commuting times. Weekends appear to steadily increase from morning to evening.\nWhile weekdays vs weekends are one possible segmentation for number of rides, seasons are also a potential group we should explore for delineations in number of rides. Figure 2.11 shows the number of rides by hour for each season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: 2x2 grid showing number of rides by hour according to the labeled season.\n\n\n\n\nThere does not appear to be any differences between seasons, except for spring having very low peaks in comparison to the other 3 seasons. Generally speaking, each season follows the same trend of number of rides by hour, with winter, summer, and fall each following very similar trends and numbers."

    "text": "Fare Amount by Time of Day and Season\nWe return to investigating fare amount since that is the principle objective of this analysis. One relationship we have yet to explore is the fare amount in relation to time of day. To do this, we will bucket each hour into a specific time of day (ie morning) and calculate the distributio of fare prices at that respective time. Figure 2.12 shows this distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Box-and-whisker plot showing distribution of fare amount by bucketed time of day.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 2.12, we see that there is no real difference in distributions. Dawn appears to have the highest variance of the 5 time buckets, but does not appear to be significant.\nTo combine some of the relationships we have explored thus far, we will look at the change in average fare, split by season and time of day. Perhaps a combination of these segments could show a possible difference in fare price. Figure 2.13 shows this relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Top panel shows the average fare price and its change over seasons, split by time of day. Bottom panel shows the average fare amount by season, split by weekday vs weekend.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13 is very informative as it shows clear delineations between average fare prices. The top panel shows that dawn by far has the highest average fare price over the other 4 time of day buckets. The closest to each other are evening and afternoon across all seasons. Interestingly, afternoon has a sharp dip in average fare price in the winter. The average afternoon fare price in winter is the lowest, followed closely by morning and evening. While we do notice clear separation between these lines, we should recognize that these prices are within essentially a dollar a part.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 2.13 shows a clear (yet small in dollar value) difference between weekend and non-weekend average fare amounts across seasons. Weekends on average have a higher fare amount than weekdays across all seasons. Additionally, The difference appears constant between the average fare amount of weekends and weekdays across all seasons. Figure 2.13 shows the usefulness of these features in helping the model capture defined segments across the data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nClustering is a useful tool in data mining whereby data points are collected together based on some predefined similarity metric. This results in a more digestible data model that can provide solid inference into how related certain attributes of data are with each other. In this post, we discuss the information theoretic co-clustering algorithm (Dhillon, Mallela, and Modha 2003) and provide a python implementation of said algorithm. We discuss the usefulness of co-clustering and propose potential future projects.\nSee this link for the paper.\n\n\nIntroduction\nCo-clustering can be defined as a family of algorithms that simultaneously clusters rows and columns. Suppose we have a matrix A that contains n rows and m columns, as shown below.\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1m} \\\\\n    a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2m} \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \\cdots & a_{nm}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nOur objective with \\(A\\) would be to identify distinct groups of data that exhibit great similarities to one another. One way to expose these groupings would be through a clustering algorithm like K-means. However, the down side to K-means is the single modality nature of the algorithm. That is, rows and columns would be clustered independetly of each other. In real-world scenarios, there are generally relationships between the rows and columns that we’d want to capture as part of our analysis. For example, suppose the rows of \\(A\\) were customers and the columns of \\(A\\) were products available. \\(a_{ij}\\) would then represent the quantities purchased by the \\(i\\)th customer for the \\(j\\)th product. We’d want to capture in our analysis the relationships between customers and the products. This is where co-clustering comes in.\nCo-clustering are families of algorithms that simultaneously cluster rows and columns. Contuining with the example above of rows representing customers and columns representing products, suppose we have the following data.\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix}\n    3 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\\(a_{ij}\\) once again represents the purchases by the \\(i\\)th customer for the \\(j\\)th product. In normal clustering approaches (like in K means clustering), we would ignore the column structure of this matrix and instead focus on the row structure only. Thus, we would probably end up with two clusters, with the the first two rows pertaining to one cluster and the last row pertaining to another. This approach, while helpful in identifying data points that closely resemble each other, does not take into account the complete picture offered by the matrix.\nIn co-clustering, we would analyze both the row structure and the column structure. We would continue to use the row structure, as illustrated in the previous example, but we would also include column clusters, more than likely clustering the first two columns together and the last one by itself. Thinking back to what this data set represents, we can now show at a more granular level what customers have similar purchase histories, as well as what products are purchased together. Thus, we have a better understanding of a customer journey and their interactions with our products.\n\n\nInformation Theoretic Co-Clustering\nNow that we have a solid foundation on what co-clustering is and its potential uses, we explore the co-clustering algorithm “Information Theoretic Co-Clustering” (Dhillon, Mallela, and Modha 2003). For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the paper link above or the referenced paper in the works cited.\nThe ITCC algorithm poses the challenge of clustering as an optimization problem using relative entropy, as shown below in Equation 3.1.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nD_{KL}(P||Q) = \\sum_{x} \\sum_{y} P(x, y) \\log \\left( \\frac{P(x, y)}{Q(x, y)} \\right) \\label{eq:kl_joint_discrete}\n\\end{equation} \\tag{3.1}\\]\nEssentially, we are trying to find a prototype or approximate joint distribution \\(Q(x,y)\\) to minimizes the distance from \\(P(x,y)\\). To do this, the ITCC algorithm attempts to calculate this minimized approximated joint disribution \\(Q(x,y)\\) by monotonically decreasing the objective function (the objective function being mutual information loss, thus minimizing the information lost between the true joint distribution and the approximate joint distribution).\nTo calculate this approximate joint distribution, a set number of row clusters and column clusters are assigned. Then, rows and columns are assigned to a specific cluster number, up to n row clusters and m column clusters. A joint cluster distribution is then calculated, which we will denote as \\(P(\\hat{x},\\hat{y})\\). The approximate joint distribution \\(Q(x,y)\\) is the calculated using \\(P(\\hat{x},\\hat{y}\\) and other conditional distributions. \\(Q(x,y)\\) is calculated by finding rows and columns that minimize Equation 3.1, relative to the conditional \\(P(X|\\hat{Y})\\) and \\(P(Y|\\hat{X})\\). A more structured run through of the algorithm is found below.\n\n\nInitialize co-cluster for rows (\\(C_X\\)) and co-cluster for columns (\\(C_Y\\))\n\n\nCalculate \\(q^{(0)}\\) \\((\\hat{X}, \\hat{Y})\\), \\(q^{(0)}\\) \\((X|\\hat{X})\\), \\(q^{(0)}\\) \\((Y|\\hat{Y})\\), and \\(q^{(0)}\\) \\((Y|\\hat{x})\\)\n\n\nCompute new column clusters for each row x where \\(C^{t+1}_{X}(x)=\\) \\(argmin_{\\hat{x}}\\) \\(D(p(Y|x) || q^{(t)}(Y|\\hat{x}))\\)\n\n\nCompute distributions \\(q^{(t+1)}\\) \\((\\hat{X}, \\hat{Y})\\), \\(q^{(t+1)}\\) \\((X|\\hat{X})\\), \\(q^{(t+1)}\\) \\((Y|\\hat{Y})\\), and \\(q^{(t+1)}\\) \\((X|\\hat{y})\\)\n\n\nCompute new column clusters for each column y where \\(C^{t+2}_{Y}(y)=\\) \\(argmin_{\\hat{y}}\\) \\(D(p(X|y) || q^{(t+1)}(X|\\hat{y}))\\)\n\n\nCompute distributions \\(q^{(t+2)}\\) \\((\\hat{X}, \\hat{Y})\\), \\(q^{(t+2)}\\) \\((X|\\hat{X})\\), \\(q^{(t+2)}\\) \\((Y|\\hat{Y})\\), and \\(q^{(t+2)}\\) \\((Y|\\hat{x})\\)\n\n\nStop and return current row and column clusters (\\(C_X,C_Y\\)) if the change in the objective function value is small. Else, repeat starting at step 2.\n\nEssentially, the algorithm forms row and column cluster prototypes, calculates the appropriate distributions to get to the approximate joint distribution \\(q(X,Y)\\), then measures the distance between \\(p(X,Y)\\) and \\(q(X,Y\\) using Equation 3.1. The algorithm is able to be monotonically decreasing due to the fact that we always select the cluster that minimizes Equation 3.1 (see steps 3 and 5 in the algorithm steps above).\n\n\nCode Walk-Through\nIn this section, we’ll walk through the various code chunks that make up our ITCC algorithm. Full disclosure, this is a very crude approach to implementing this algorithm. There are far better implementations of this algorithm along with other co-clustering algorithms (e.g. scikit learn). This is merely an educational exercise by me to practice implementing clustering algorithms.\nTo begin the code walk through, we will initialize our joint distribution \\(P(X,Y)\\), which is found below. This is the same joint distribution used in the ITCC paper.\n\n#Initialize test array\ntest_arr = np.array([.05, .05, .05, 0, 0, 0, \n          .05, .05, .05, 0, 0, 0, \n          0, 0, 0, .05, .05, .05, \n          0, 0, 0, .05, .05, .05, \n          .04, .04, 0, .04, .04, .04,\n          .04, .04, .04, 0, .04, .04]).reshape(6,6)\n\nOur \\(P(X,Y)\\) is a 6x6 matrix. We will attempt to find the optimal 3 row clusters and 2 columns clusters using our ITCC implementation, just as performed in the ITCC paper. To do this, we will implement various functions that calculate the necessary distributions for eventually comparing \\(P(X,Y)\\) and \\(Q(X,Y)\\).\nOur first function in the code walk through is calculating the joint distribution \\(Q(\\hat{X},\\hat{Y})\\), which is the joint distribution of the row and column clusters. The code to do this is found below.\n\n#Define function for calculating joint distribution\ndef calc_joint(x: dict, y: dict, a: np.array) -&gt; np.array:\n    joint_arr = np.zeros((len(x), len(y)))\n    #joint_arr = {}\n    for i, j in x.items():\n        for z, p in y.items():\n            ind = np.ix_(j,p)\n            joint_arr[i,z] = a[ind].sum()\n    \n    return joint_arr\n\nThe function accepts the row clusters, column clusters, and joint distribution \\(P(X,Y)\\). We chose to use dictionaries to illustrate the structure of co cluster prototypes with the co cluster number as the key and the value being a list of indices where the respective row(s) or column(s) lie. The function returns the mxn array, where m is the number of row clusters and n is the number of columns clusters.\nThe next function we define is \\(Q(X|\\hat{X})\\). This accepts the joint distribution \\(P(X,Y)\\) and the dictionary for the row cluster prototypes. The function then returns a mxn matrix where m is the number of rows in the original matrix (or the total number of rows from all the row clusters) and n is the number of row clusters.\n\n#Define function for calculating conditional of x given x_hat\ndef calc_x_cond(jd: np.array, x_ind: dict) -&gt; np.array:\n    x_mar = jd.sum(axis=1)\n    xhat_mar = calc_x_mar(jd, x_ind)\n    cond_dist = np.zeros((len(x_mar), len(x_ind)))\n    \n    for key, val in x_ind.items():\n        for idx, prb in enumerate(x_mar):\n            if idx in val:\n                cond_dist[idx,key] = prb / xhat_mar[key]\n            else:\n                cond_dist[idx,key] = 0\n    \n    return cond_dist\n\n\\(Q(\\hat{X}|\\hat{Y})\\) is the conditional distribution of the \\(\\hat{X}\\) given \\(\\hat{Y}\\). This just becomes the joint distribution \\(Q(\\hat{X},\\hat{Y})\\) divided by the marginal of \\(Q(\\hat{Y})\\). The function returns a mxn matrix where m is the number of row clusters and n is the number of column clusters.\n\n#Define function for calculation conditional of x_hat given y_hat\ndef calc_xhat_cond(jd: np.array) -&gt; np.array:\n    cond_dist = np.zeros((jd.shape[0], jd.shape[1]))\n    \n    for j in range(jd.shape[1]):\n        y_mar = jd[:,j].sum()\n        for i in range(jd.shape[0]):\n            if y_mar == 0:\n                cond_dist[i,j] = 0\n            else:\n                cond_dist[i,j] = jd[i,j] / y_mar\n    \n    return cond_dist\n\n\\(Q(X|\\hat{Y})\\) is calculated as the product of \\(Q(X|\\hat{X})Q(\\hat{X}|\\hat{Y})\\). This function accepts then the previously calculated \\(Q(X|\\hat{X})\\) distribution and the \\(Q(\\hat{X}|\\hat{Y})\\) distribution. This function returns a mxn matrix where m is the number of rows from the original joint distribution \\(P(X,Y)\\) and n is the the number of columns from the same said distribution.\n\n#Define function for calculating x given y_hat\ndef calc_x_cond_yhat(x_xhat: np.array, xhat_yhat: np.array, x_ind: dict, y_ind: dict) -&gt; np.array:\n    full_arr = []\n    \n    for y_key, y_val in y_ind.items():\n        for _ in range(len(y_val)):\n            row = []\n            for x_key, x_val in x_ind.items():\n                row.extend(xhat_yhat[x_key,y_key] * x_xhat[x_val, x_key])\n            full_arr.append(row)\n            \n    return np.array(full_arr)\n\nWe now arrive at defining the column distributions, first with \\(Q(Y|\\hat{Y})\\). This function accepts the primary joint distribution and the dictionary of \\(\\hat{Y}\\). The function returns a matrix of dimension mxn where m is the number of columns in the original joint distribution and n is the number of column clusters.\n\n#Define function for calculating conditional of y given y_hat\ndef calc_y_cond(jd: np.array, y_ind: dict) -&gt; np.array:\n    y_mar = jd.sum(axis=0)\n    yhat_mar = calc_y_mar(jd, y_ind)\n    cond_dist = np.zeros((len(y_mar), len(y_ind)))\n    \n    for key, val in y_ind.items():\n        for idx, prb in enumerate(y_mar):\n            if idx in val:\n                cond_dist[idx,key] = prb / yhat_mar[key]\n            else:\n                cond_dist[idx,key] = 0\n    \n    return cond_dist\n\n\\(Q(\\hat{Y}|\\hat{X})\\) is calculated very similariy to \\(Q(\\hat{X}|\\hat{Y})\\) and returns, like the previous function, the same dimension of the of the joint co cluster distribution.\n\n#Define function for calculating conditional of y_hat given x_hat\ndef calc_yhat_cond(jd: np.array) -&gt; np.array:\n    cond_dist = np.zeros((jd.shape[0], jd.shape[1]))\n    \n    for i in range(jd.shape[0]):\n        x_mar = jd[i,:].sum()\n        for j in range(jd.shape[1]):\n            if x_mar == 0:\n                cond_dist[i,j] = 0\n            else:\n                cond_dist[i,j] = jd[i,j] / x_mar\n    \n    return cond_dist\n\n\\(Q(Y|\\hat{X})\\) is equal to the product of \\(Q(Y|\\hat{Y}) Q(\\hat{Y}|\\hat{X})\\). This function accepts the \\(Q(Y|\\hat{Y})\\) distribution, \\(Q(\\hat{Y}|\\hat{X})\\) distribution, the column cluster dictionary, and the row cluster dictionary. The function returns a mxn matrix of the same dimension of the original joint distribution.\n\n#Define function for calculating y given x_hat\ndef calc_y_cond_xhat(y_yhat: np.array, yhat_xhat: np.array, y_ind: dict, x_ind: dict) -&gt; np.array:\n    full_arr = []\n    \n    for x_key, x_val in x_ind.items():\n        for _ in range(len(x_val)):\n            row = []\n            for y_key, y_val in y_ind.items():\n                row.extend(yhat_xhat[x_key,y_key] * y_yhat[y_val, y_key])\n            full_arr.append(row)\n            \n    return np.array(full_arr)\n\n\\(C_X\\) represents our current row clusters. The function below takes in the distributions \\(Q(Y|\\hat{X}\\) and \\(P(Y|X)\\), along with the mappings of each row to row to cluster using the x_ind dictionary. This function utilizes Equation 3.1 to find calculate the distance between these distributions. It then selects the cluster row prototype that minimizes the distance between a row of the true distribution and that of the approximate distribution. The function returns a dictionary with the new row cluster prototypes.\n\n#Define function for calculation next c_x\ndef next_cx(y_xhat: np.array, y_x: np.array, x_ind: dict) -&gt; dict:\n    new_x_hat = {key: [] for key in x_ind}\n\n    for i in range(y_x.shape[0]):\n        temp_idx = []\n    \n        for key, val in x_ind.items():\n            proto = np.mean(y_xhat[val,:], axis=0)\n            kl_res = np.nan_to_num(kl_div(y_x[i,:], proto), posinf=10, neginf=-10)\n            #kl_res = rel_entr(y_x[i,:], proto)\n            temp_idx.append(np.sum(kl_res))\n       \n        temp_val = np.argmin(np.array(temp_idx))\n        #temp_val = tie_breaker(temp_idx)\n        new_x_hat[temp_val].append(i)\n    \n    return new_x_hat\n\nSimilarily to the function above \\(C_Y\\) represents our current column clusters. The function utilizes \\(Q(X|\\hat{Y})\\) and \\(P(X|Y)\\) along with the mappings found in y_ind, which contain the mappings of columns to column clusters. It then uses Equation 3.1 to perform the same calculations used in \\(C_X\\). This function also returns a dictionary with the new mappings for column cluster prototypes.\n\n#Define function for calculation next c_y\ndef next_cy(x_yhat: np.array, x_y: np.array, y_ind: dict) -&gt; dict:\n    new_y_hat = {key: [] for key in y_ind}\n\n    for i in range(x_y.shape[1]):\n        temp_idx = []\n\n        for key, val in y_ind.items():\n            proto = np.mean(x_yhat[:,val], axis=1)\n            kl_res = np.nan_to_num(kl_div(x_y[:,i], proto), posinf=10, neginf=-10)\n            #kl_res = rel_entr(x_y[:,i], proto)\n            temp_idx.append(np.sum(kl_res))\n            \n        temp_val = np.argmin(np.array(temp_idx))\n        #temp_val = tie_breaker(temp_idx)\n        new_y_hat[temp_val].append(i)\n       \n    return new_y_hat\n\nThis function is where we formally define the co-clustering algorithm utilizing the functions defined above as well as the steps outline for the ITCC algorithm above. We refer the reader to the above section “Information Theoretic Co-Clustering”.

    "text": "What’s the system?\nThe first question can be answered by understanding the business objective. We want customers to utilize our service for their food delivery needs. We promote our service by promising fast and accurate delivery right to their doors. Additionally, since our drivers are critical to the operations of this business, we want to keep our drivers as busy as possible to ensure they maximize earnings. Essentially, our business objective is to maintain optimal customer service to those who order while also providing good opportunities to our deliverers to make money. How can we optimize for both objectives simultaneously? Or rather, what system are we trying to control to fulfill this objective? The system we are aiming to control for Food-Ez is the queue. If we can control the queue (i.e. drive the queue to zero), customers orders will be assigned quickly and be delivered quickly. Subsequently, if the queue is managed correctly, drivers’ objective of maximizing earnings will also be optimized. The queue is the system for which we will be designing a controller."

    "text": "What should we feedback?\nNow that we have identified what the system is, we can identify what elements of the system we should report back to the controller. If we are aiming to optimize the queue, we should report back metrics of queue health. Things like queue length, status of orders, status of drivers, location of dropoff and pickup, etc. The list below enumerates some of the crucial feedback elements we will provide to the controller.\n\nOrder Status (Pending, Assigned, En Route, Delivered)\nDriver Status (Idle, Assigned, En Route, Delivered)\nOrder Location (Pickup Location, Dropoff Location)\nDriver Location\nDriver Assigned Orders\n\nFor question two, we are essentially defining the states of important elements in our system. In control theory, this fundamental approach is known as representing a system using state-space equations. The formal equations are found in Equation 3.1.\n\\[\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}(t)\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{y}(t) = \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{u}(t)\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nEquation 3.1 states that the rate of change of the state vector \\(\\dot{x}(t)\\) at time \\(t\\) is equal to the current state vector \\(x(t)\\) multiplied by the dynamics matrix \\(A\\), plus the input vector \\(u(t)\\) multiplied by the input matrix \\(B\\). The system’s output, \\(y(t)\\), is equal to the current state vector of the system \\(x(t)\\) multiplied by the output matrix \\(C\\) plus input vector \\(u(t)\\) multiplied by the feedthrough matrix \\(D\\). Relating these equations back to our control diagram, the controller observes \\(y(t)\\) and compares it against a predetermined reference or baseline. Based on that judgement, the controller sends inputs \\(u(t)\\) back to the system. This input, along with the current state of the system, determines the instantaneous rate of change of the system’s state. This state then produces output \\(y(t)\\), and the process repeats itself.\nA classic example of this is cruise control in a car. The controller observes the car’s speed and compares it against the set cruise speed. It then sends inputs to the engine to adjust the speed accordingly. These inputs, alongside other dynamics (e.g., drag, incline), influence the car’s state, which in turn contributes to the measured output \\(y(t)\\).\nWhile these explanations have been incredibly simplified, they illustrate the important principle that a system can be adjusted in a closed-loop by providing crucial feedback to the controller on its current operation. In our scenario, we want to know the locations and destinations of drivers, the status of food preparation, and other relevant parameters, in order to optimally assign orders within the queue and achieve our business objectives."

We now need to implement actions that optimize the system’s efficiency. In the previous section(s), we have identified the key objective. We need to assign orders to drivers such that orders get to their locations ASAP while also providing enough work to the drivers. There are several approaches to address this problem and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. We could implement logic such that we always assign the closest driver the order that comes in. Another approach would be holding orders for longer in the queue to see if a more “optimally” positioned driver comes along to take multiple orders nearby. We need sound strategy to identify which algorithmic process we should implement. For Food-Ez, it is optimizing the queue such that we minimize delivery time and maximize driver utilization (i.e. minimize driver idle time). Therefore, we need to design a controller that will balance these two objectives."

    "text": "Current approach: bipartite matching\nThe original logic followed by Food-Ez (and additionally DoorDash) was designed by framing the task as a bipartite matching problem. Essentially, this problem involves finding a set of edges in a bipartite graph such that no two edges share a common vertex, thereby matching elements from two distinct sets. In the context of food delivery, this essentially means every order can only have one driver and every driver can only have one order. To do this efficiently to fulfill business objectives such as minimizing delivery time, problems like this can be solved using algorithms like the Hungarian algorithm [3].\nWhile this approach fulfills the business objective, simple examples illustrate the weaknesses of this approach. Suppose a deliverer is assigned an order and is heading to the restaurant. On the way, the driver passes another restaurant that just received an order that will be ready shortly. Furthermore, the dropoff location of this order is nearby the dropoff location of the first order. Instead of assigning this order to the driver, the system must assign another driver to this order. While more drivers are utilized in this approach, drivers could be used more efficiently."

    "text": "An example via queue theory\nTo illustrate this, let’s pose the simple scenario of a single deliverer working for Food-Ez. Utilizing queue theory, we’ll assume this is an M/M/1 queue where the arrival process is modeled by a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda = 1\\) (per hour), the service distribution is an exponential distribution with \\(\\mu = 2\\) (per hour), and there is a single server (deliverer).\nWith these metrics, we can calculate system utilization (or driver utilization in our case). This is defined as \\(\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}\\), or the ratio between arrival rate and service rate. In our case, for a deliverer in the bipartite matching system, we get 50% driver utilization. While this is not bad, the average queue wait time for an order is defined as \\(W_{q} = \\frac{L_{q}}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(L_{q}\\) is average length of queue. The average length of the queue here is .5 so in our scenario, queue wait time is about .5 hours or 30 minutes. Since our deliverer can only handle one order at a time, every order on average would have to wait 30 minutes in the queue.\nIn a different approach, let’s say a deliverer can now take two orders concurrently and assume it is no further than a 10 minute drive to complete. In this case, a deliverer can fulfill 2 orders in about 40 minutes (1 order / 30 mins was the rate before). Converting this to hours, a deliverer can now fulfill 3 orders per hour, thus changing our deliverer utilization rate from 50% to 33%. More importantly, the queue wait time decreases from 30 minutes to 10 minutes (average queue length in this scenario is ~.167 orders, which is then divided by 1 order per hour). Not only could our drivers stay more busy if arrival rates increased, but our customers would have to wait only a third of the old time (if our simple assumptions hold)!"

    "text": "Understanding Optimal Efficiency with Cycle Time and Throughput Rate\nTo begin our analysis, we establish the current flow of traffic in the store, specifically at checkouts. To do this, we’ll look at the current checkout time distribution at SEA, shown in Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Checkout time distribution in seconds for SEA store.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 3.1, we expect a customer at the SEA store to take about 120 seconds on average to complete the checkout process. We’ll assume the process of checkout to be as follows.\n\nCustomer scans membership card (begins timer).\nCustomer begins scanning each individual item and places item on side platform next to register.\nAfter scanning all items, customer pays for items (only accepts cards at self-checkouts).\nCustomer returns all items to cart and transaction ends.\n\nThe time to move one unit (ie one customer) through the above process is known as cycle time (CT). In MW stores, there are 4 self-checkout registers available for customers to use. In the optimal scenario, each station would begin and end in parallel and the demand for each station would immediately be filled. The total output from these 4 stations over a specified time interval is defined as throughput rate (TPR). The relations between CT and TPR are shown in Equation 3.1.\n\\[\nCT = \\text{average time to process one unit}\n\\] \\[\nTPR = \\frac{\\text{num units produced}}{\\text{total time elapsed}}\n\\] \\[\nTPR = \\frac{1}{CT}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nFrom Equation 3.1, TPR is the reciprocal of CT. Since we have CT, we know TPR must equal 1 / 120 seconds. To gain a more practical view of the operations, we’ll convert this to minutes and say that our TPR is 1 / 2 minutes, or half a customer per minute is our TPR. Additionally, since we have 4 stations, we multiply this TPR by 4 to get 2 customers per minute on average. This is the assumed peak efficiency of our current system."

    "text": "Queue Theory\nIn the previous section, we established the peak efficiency the system can handle through CT and TPR. One of the big assumptions we placed on this system was a steady-state flow, meaning there would be immediate demand for each station once they became free. In the real-world, steady state is nearly impossible to achieve. Additionally (and possibly more importantly for us), understanding the current wait time of customers will help us to identify how speeding up the above system can help decrease wait time. This branch of operations is known as queue theory.\nWhile we will not provide an exhaustive tutorial on queue theory in this post, we will provide the necessary overview for this section. To do this, we begin with Kendall’s Notation[1]. Kendall’s notation provides a framework where we identify the 3 core components of queue creation, shown in Equation 3.2.\n\\[\nA: \\text{arrival process distribution (how often customers arrive)}\n\\] \\[\nB: \\text{service time distribution (how long it takes to serve a customer)}\n\\] \\[\nC: \\text{number of servers}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nFrom the previous section, we learned B (defined as our CT) and C (4 self-checkout stations). We must now identify A. Let \\(\\lambda\\) denote the average arrival rate of customers. In the context of our problem, we will suppose \\(\\lambda\\) to be the average arrival rate during our peak hours (since slow hours do not tend to have any kind of queue). The arrival distribution (which we model as a poisson distribution) is shown below in Figure 3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Arrival distribution of customers during peak hours.\n\n\n\n\nOn average (during peak hours), we have about 2 customers arriving per minute. To better know the amount of time our registers are busy, we calculate system utilization, commonly denoted by \\(\\rho\\). The formula for \\(\\rho\\) is found in Equation 3.3.\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{c\\mu}\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nSystem utilization is the defined as the ratio between the average arrival rate and the TPR we previously calculted. In our case, \\(\\rho\\) comes out to be .95, or 95%. According to queue theory, a system is stable if \\(\\rho\\) is &lt; 1. Our current system is therefore stable and allows us to use M/M/c formulas to calculate relevant wait time and queue length metrics. The formulas used all depend on Little’s Law[2], illustrated in Equation 3.4.\n\\[\nL = \\lambda W\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nL represents the number of customers in the queue, \\(\\lambda\\) is the arrival rate of the customers, and W is the wait time of the customers. For our system specifically, we use an adapted version of Equation 3.4, as shown in Equation 3.5.\n\\[\nL_{q} = \\frac{P_w \\rho}{1-\\rho}\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nEquation 3.5 utilizes Erlang’s formula[3] to get \\(P_w\\), which is the probability of an arriving customer having to wait in the queue. This is scaled by result of \\(\\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho}\\). The result gives us the average length of the queue at any point in time (during peak hours). While we won’t cover the full derivation and calculation of \\(P_w\\), we provide that the value of it is approximately .9. Plugging this value in with our \\(\\rho\\) value, we get \\(L_q\\) is equal to about 16.93, or about 17 people on average are waiting in the queue during peak shopping hours. That’s a lot of people!\nTo calculate the average time a customer waits in the queue, we utilize Equation 3.4 by rearranging the equation to solve for W. After performing some calculations, we get W is equal to 8.91 minutes. MW customers on average wait almost 9 minutes in line during peak shopping hours!"

    "text": "Experiment Design 1: Difference-in-Differences\nOne approach we can take to help MW is to assign just one store the treatment and compare it with another store that is fairly comparable to the treated store. This approach is know as the Difference-in-Differences (DiD)[4] model. DiD is known as a quasi-experimental design since it doesn’t rely on random assignment. Instead, it “mimics” the effects of RCTs by accounting for unobserved confounders by measuring the change in outcomes to a similar unit. Specifically, this is known as the parallel trends assumption. DiD assumes that both the treated unit and the control unit follow parallel trends had there not been any intervention. Mathematically, this is represented as a linear model as shown in Equation 4.1.\n\\[\nY_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}SEA_{i} + \\beta_{2}POST_{i} + \\beta_{3}(SEA_{i}*POST_{i}) + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\n\\(Y_{i}\\) is the outcome being measured (average checkout time), \\(SEA_{i}\\) is a dummy variable indicating whether the observation is in Seattle or not. \\(POST_{i}\\) is a dummy variable indicating whether or not the observation occurred after the intervention. We then have the interaction term where \\(\\beta_{3}\\) would show the average treatment effect between Seattle and the control city after the intervention was applied.\nTo get a little more granular into how a simple OLS regression model derives causal effects from this design, consider the basic case of the potential outcomes framework[5]. We extend this to DiD by saying each observation takes on an outcome of \\(Y_{D}(T)\\), where D is the treatment assignment (1 for Seattle and 0 for the control) and T is the time period (1 for post intervention and 0 for pre intervention). In the counterfactual world, we would be able to calculate the average treatment effect of treated (ATT) by computing \\(E[Y_{1}(1) - Y_{0}(1)|D=1]\\). However, \\(Y_{0}(1)\\) is the counterfactual for any given observation where we observe the treated in post intervention. To work around this, we replace the missing counterfactual by setting it equal to \\(E[Y_{0}(0)|D=1] + (E[Y_{0}(1)|D=0] - E[Y_{0}(0)|D=0])\\). With a bit of rearranging to the original “preferred” equation, we arrive at Equation 4.2.\n\\[\nATT = (E[Y(1)| D=1] - E[Y(0)| D=1]) - (E[Y(1)| D=0] - E[Y(0)| D=0])\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nIn essence, we take the difference between the treatment post and pre intervention and the difference between the control post and pre intervention, then take the difference of those differences. Hence, we arrive at the name “difference-in-differences”."

Figure 4.1 shows the data we collected over time at both SEA and SF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\navg_ct\nsea\npost_int\n\n\n\n\n0\n115.429541\n1\nFalse\n\n\n1\n130.756135\n0\nFalse\n\n\n2\n113.958007\n1\nFalse\n\n\n3\n122.035513\n0\nFalse\n\n\n4\n114.782158\n1\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Seattle vs San Francisco average checkout time over 100 days.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 4.1, we see that SEA and SF follow similar trends up till time of intervention. When the scanner guns are implemented, there is a sharp decrease in average check-out time with a continual downward trend. This is a great indication that our program provided significant decrease to CT. To get a numerical value from this graph, we can extract it manually by performing the above calculations using the data or by fitting a OLS model (they both provide the same result. Below we provide both results.\n\n\nTrue DiD Estimate: -27.421232456603718\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoef\nstd err\nt\nP&gt;|t|\n[0.025\n0.975]\n\n\nIntercept\n130.4273\n0.607\n214.823\n0.000\n129.230\n131.625\n\n\npost_int[T.True]\n6.8350\n0.867\n7.880\n0.000\n5.125\n8.546\n\n\nsea\n-12.1969\n0.859\n-14.205\n0.000\n-13.890\n-10.504\n\n\nsea:post_int[T.True]\n-27.4212\n1.227\n-22.355\n0.000\n-29.840\n-25.002\n\n\n\n\n\nThe added value we gain from fitting the OLS is that we gain SE estimates and subsequent CI estimates. According to our model, scanner guns provide an on average decrease of about 27 seconds. Recalling what we calculated in the operations section, our new CT would be approximately 93 seconds. This means our new TPR would be approximately 2.58 customers per minute (a 29% increase in TPR). This results in a change in system utilization from 95% to about 74%. From here, we calculate our average queue length to be 1.36 customers (a 92% decrease in average queue length!) which then results in average wait time in the queue to be about 43 seconds (or .715 minutes, also a 92% decrease!).\nAccording to our models, the scanner guns are a huge success and represent a major opportunity for MW to increase customer satisfaction through higher operational efficiency. While we did derive useful causal effects from this experiment, MW should obviously consider other factors like feasability of company wide adoption, cost and maintenance of the equipment, and potential other factors like increases in theft from not scanning all items."

    "section": "Experimental Design 2: Synthetic Control",
    "text": "Experimental Design 2: Synthetic Control\nAs explained in the DiD section, one of the key assumtions behind the DiD model is the parallel trends assumption. In order for our model to be valid, we need to find an adequate enough control unit that follows a close enough parallel trend, along with the other usual assumptions of causality. This assumption is regularly broken in the real world as it is difficult to find a control unit that satisfies the model assumptions.\nInstead of attempting to find a single control unit to compare our control to, we can “create” our own control by using synthetic control methods[6]. We create a synthetic control by taking a weighted average of all our possible controls (i.e. our donor pool) that best mimics the pre-intervention behavior of our treatment unit. An popular example of this is also found in [7] where the authors used SCM to model the effect of Califronia’s tobacco tax policy.\nIn our example, we would take a weighted average of our other 10 stores to form a synthetic control to compare against Seattle. Let’s quickly walk through what the math looks like in SCM.\nSCM attempts to estimate the counterfactual \\(Y_{t}^{N}\\), that is, the response of our treatment unit had the intervention never happened (i.e. the response of Seattle had it never received scanner guns). SCM estimates this counterfactual through a weighted average across the responses of the donor pool, as shown in Equation 4.3.\n\\[\nY_{t}^{N} \\approx \\sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_{j} Y_{jt}\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\nThe weights are calculated by finding the minimum distance between \\(X_{1}\\) (the pre-intervention characteristics of the treated unit) and \\(X_{0}W\\) (the pre-intervention characteristics of a control unit). This minimization is subject to two constraints: all weights must be greater than or equal to 0 and all weights must sum to 1. Once these weights are calculated, they are applied to the post-intervention responses of the control units. The distance between the treated unit and the synthetic control is then the estimated ATT.\nIn our analysis, we used pysyncon[8] to create our synthetic control. After preparing our data for it, we obtained the following weights.\n\n\n1     0.028\n2     0.000\n3     0.000\n4     0.000\n5     0.297\n6     0.000\n7     0.000\n8     0.525\n9     0.149\n10    0.000\nName: weights, dtype: float64\n\n\nAs we can see, the closest city is city 8, followed by city 5, 9, and 1. The rest of the cities are not included in the weighted average. The plot of our synthetic control vs treated is found below in Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Seattle vs Synthetic control over time.\n\n\n\n\nOur SC appears to follow the trajectory and variation of Seattle fairly well (in a real SCM, we’d want it better but this suffices for this analysis). As such, when the intervention occurs, we can estimate the ATT via the distance between these two units. The distance overtime between these two are shown in Figure 4.3. The ATT immediately follows below it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Gap plot for Seattle vs Synthetic control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{'att': -20.67706963332358, 'se': 0.8177388666624705}\n\n\nFrom both Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3, as well as the estimated ATT, the scanner guns appear to be a viable program for MW. Since we covered the effects on the operational efficiecny of this program in the previous experiment, we won’t go through it as detailed here. As mentioned earlier and as noticed in Figure 4.3, we’d want to aim for a better SC to avoid the huge spikes in distance from the treated unit pre-intervention."

Additionally, if possible, understanding the driving factors behind why certain classes are more popular or which classes are the most variable semester-to-semester is of particular interest.\nWe demonstrate in this post the power of Bayesian forecasting, utilizing a two-part model.

    "text": "More exploration (For enhanced Bayesian Modeling)\nWhile the above model successfully performed better than our “frequentist” approach, it still has not accomplished our ultimate goal of forecasting down to the classroom level. How can we utilize our first model as a viable resource to build a second model that can forecast down to the classroom level?\nThe question to explore now is “do we believe that the percent share of enrollment by class varies or is relatively constant?”. Essentially, if we discover that classes are generally consistent in how much percent of enrollment they take each fall term, then we can build a model that forecasts from our first model and utilizes class specific information to predict its percent share of enrollment. For example, suppose we have an intro level math class that for 3 fall terms had percent share of enrollment of: 2%, 3%, 4%. Utilizing our first model that predicts the entire university enrollment, we can generate a posterior predictive distribution that can predict the percent change in percent share of enrollment and multiply that change in value by the first predicted value (total university enrollment) to get a class specific enrollment value.

However, we know that they aren’t all unique in their own size.

Below in Figure 4.5 shows a distribution of count of students for classes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Histogram of count of students in classes\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the great majority of class sizes are found below 1000 students. We will need to take this into account when deciding how to divide our class size lines. While there are different ways of performing this in a more analytical way (i.e. segmentation analysis), we will arbitrarily decide on these buckets based on our EDA (see github repo for full EDA code).\nOne plot that we will include in this post is found in Figure 4.6. This figure shows the distribution for percent change in percent share of enrollment for each of our arbitrarily selected class sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: 2x4 grid of histograms showing the distribution of percent change in percent share of enrollment for each class size\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6 is telling in many ways. First, x-small classes are generally non-variable with a few large outliers (this also is acceptable because a x-small class can double in size fairly easily). Small, medium, and large classes are approximately normal in their distribution because these are the class sizes with the most observations (kind of like a fun way of seeing the CLT). All other larger classes appear almost uniform in their distributions due to their small respective sample sizes."

After fitting our model to the data, we obtain the below results.\n\n\n\n                    mean       std    median      5.0%     95.0%     n_eff     r_hat\n   class_mu[0]      0.13      0.02      0.13      0.09      0.17   3864.53      1.00\n   class_mu[1]      0.12      0.02      0.12      0.09      0.16   4569.29      1.00\n   class_mu[2]      0.09      0.01      0.09      0.07      0.12   5660.38      1.00\n   class_mu[3]      0.11      0.02      0.11      0.07      0.15   5829.37      1.00\n   class_mu[4]      0.08      0.04      0.08      0.01      0.15   2455.60      1.00\n   class_mu[5]      0.02      0.02      0.02     -0.01      0.05   3977.78      1.00\n   class_mu[6]     -0.03      0.04     -0.03     -0.09      0.03   1414.55      1.00\n   class_mu[7]      0.01      0.05      0.01     -0.06      0.09   2553.92      1.00\nclass_sigma[0]      1.22      0.02      1.22      1.19      1.25   5456.28      1.00\nclass_sigma[1]      0.55      0.02      0.55      0.53      0.58   2663.55      1.00\nclass_sigma[2]      0.44      0.01      0.44      0.42      0.46   3291.40      1.00\nclass_sigma[3]      0.36      0.02      0.36      0.33      0.38   2453.18      1.00\nclass_sigma[4]      0.24      0.03      0.23      0.19      0.28   2273.90      1.00\nclass_sigma[5]      0.07      0.01      0.07      0.05      0.09   2460.03      1.00\nclass_sigma[6]      0.08      0.04      0.07      0.03      0.13    965.08      1.00\nclass_sigma[7]      0.13      0.05      0.12      0.07      0.19   2506.08      1.00\n            mu      0.05      0.11      0.05     -0.13      0.23   3127.97      1.00\n         sigma      0.37      0.06      0.36      0.27      0.46   2508.96      1.00\n\nNumber of divergences: 0\n\n\nclass_mu[0] represents the distribution for class size x-small while class_mu[7] represents class size giant. All other class sizes are between these ranges in ascending order (x-small to giant). Additionally, our n_eff and r_hat scores show that our sampler performed very well and that each distribution achieved sufficient stationarity and good mixing. To confirm our results using visuals, we can look at Figure 4.7.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: 2x8 trace plots of each class size. Top row are mu trace plots and bottom row are sigma trace plots\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 4.7, we see that each mu and sigma trace plot per class appear to have good mixing and acceptable stationarity. Now that we have checked our MCMC diagnostics, we can begin exploring the generated posteriors from our model. Figure 4.8 shows respective distributions for class size’s mu parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: 2x4 grid of posterior distributions for each class size for parameter mu\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8 shows each class size mu parameter is approximately normally distributed. It is interesting to note where each distribution is centered. X-small is centered around .13 whereas larger classes like xxx-large are more centered around 0. It appears the there is a higher chance for smaller classes to have an increase in percent change in percent share of enrollment, whereas larger classes don’t vary as much. Larger classes seem to stay most constant term by term, which is not too surprising. A similar plot for class size sigma parameter is found in Figure 4.9.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: 2x4 grid of posterior distributions for each class size for parameter sigma\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, we notice that as the class size increases, the variability in sigma decreases.\n\nPosterior Predictive Distribution (Hierarchical Model)\nJust as we performed in the first model of this analysis, we will generate a posterior predictive distribution to make class specific predictions. Since we built a hierarchical model, we will generate 8 separate PPDs for each class size. Figure 4.10 shows the respective PPD for each class size.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: 2x4 grid of posterior predictive distributions for each class size\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10 shows just how variable the smaller classes can be. While the x-small through medium classes are all relatively centered around 0 (possibly due to scale of x axis), the variation in their predictions are fairly wide, especially in x-small classes. However, this should not be too problematic as an x-small class of size 10, even doubling in size, would only be 20. More than likely 1 professor and 1 TA would still be sufficient for this class.\nIn contrast, we see that our larger classes do not have nearly as much predicted variability (a repeated theme we have mentioned a lot). This is good to know since these classes require the most resources. Since they appear to be reliably consistent, we can “trust” more in the predictions and know they will not be too far off from the usual.\nFor example, take the class MATH 140 at TAMU. It is considered an intro level math course that many students must take in order to progress in their respective majors. It is considered a xxx-large class due to its popularity. Below is a point prediction for this class.\n\n\nBayes Prediction for % change in pct_enroll: -0.027\nTrue Value for % change in pct_enroll: 0.180\n\n\nThe model, due to its MAP, incorretly predicted the percent change in percent share of enrollment. However, point estimates in continuous predictions are rarely ever correct and thus require an interval prediction to ensure that our model at least captures the value within the interval. Below is a 95% PI for MATH 140.\n\n\n95% Prediction Interval for % change in pct_enroll: (-0.229, 0.179)\n\n\nAs we can see, our interval would include the actual value (even if it is on the farthest outside). This indicates that the true value that occured is in fact a possibel anomaly. That is, it is a plausible value but is just not very likely. Nonetheless, because we used a Bayesian approach, we can probabilistically say that it is a possible value in the range of 95% probability.\nIn order to properly predict the actual count of student enrollment by class, as mentioned previously, we use Equation 4.2. Below is the predicted number of students, both point estimate and 95% PI.\n\n\nPoint Estimate for MATH 140: 3527\nActual Value for MATH 140: 4392\n\n\n\n\n95% Prediction Interval for MATH 140: (2794, 4271)\n\n\nAs we can see, the 95% prediction interval is not far off from the actual value. The missing values would be trivial in such a large class forecast (at least for allocating university resources). While this test case has been informative, we should test another class to ensure our model is not always facing possible anomalies. To do this, we will look at MATH 308. Below is the point prediction for MATH 308.\n\n\nBayes Prediction for % change in pct_enroll: 0.105\nTrue Value for % change in pct_enroll: 0.051\n\n\nAs we can see, this time our model is over estimating the point estimate for percent change in percent share of enrollment. Our model predicts about a 10% increase in percent share of enrollment when the actual 2023 value was about 5%. While the point estimate is incorrect, it is not too far off in terms of practical prediction. Below is the corresponding 95% PI and resulting predictions from the point estimate and the PI.\n\n\n95% Prediction Interval for % change in pct_enroll: (-0.610, 0.832)\n\n\n\n\nPoint Estimate for MATH 308: 990\nActual Value for MATH 308: 967\n\n\n\n\n95% Prediction Interval for MATH 308: (349, 1640)\n\n\nAs mentioned above, our point estimate from a practical point of view is not too far from the actual value and would not have any major ramifications from a resource allocation point of view. Our 95% PI though, it quite wide. While it is slightly narrower than our 95% PI for MATH 140, it is still a very large range that would not be too useful for forecasting. Nonetheless, this model has proven to be very useful in predicting (especially from a practical point of view) the percent change in percent share of enrollment. Combined with the first model, we have created a system for forecasting class enrollment down to specific class levels."

To verify this visually, we can look at Figure 4.11.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: 2x4 grid of trace plots for each class size\n\n\n\n\nThe betas for each class size level appear to be well mixed and stationary. To verify the betas for each college, we can look at Figure 4.12.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: 2x4 grid of trace plots for each college\n\n\n\n\nJust as with Figure 4.11, we can see that each college appears to have reached appropriate stationarity and mixing. Now that we have verified that our sampler functioned well, we can begin investigating the posterior distributions. Figure 4.13 shows the posterior distributions of each class size and Figure 4.14 shows the posterior distributions for each college.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Posterior distributions of each class size beta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Posterior distributions of each college beta\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that in both Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14, we see that most of the distributions are relatively centered around the point. The distinguishing feature for each distribution is the respective spread.\nJust as we performed for our first hierarchical model, we can perform predictions by generating a posterior predictive distribution (see Equation 4.1). We will first explore the predictions with this model for MATH 308 and compare it to our predictions from our first hierarchical model. The results are shown below.\n\n\nMean of pred_lm: 0.0403\n95% PI of pred_lm: (-0.0108, 0.0907)\nTrue value of pct_enroll_yoy: 0.0507\nPredicted Number of Students: 932\n95% PI of Number of Students: (886, 977)\nTrue Number of Students: 967\n\n\nThe very notable change in our prediction from our hierarchical linear model is that our PI range has shrunk significantly. Instead of the upper limit being close to .8, our upper limit of our 95% PI is approximately .09. That is a significant improvement! Our new hierarchical model also still contains the true value of percent change in percent share of enrollment. As we can see from above, our 95% PI for the predicted number of students is significantly better than before and would be of much better use practically for forecasting. We can perform this exercise again with predictions for MATH 140. Below are our results.\n\n\nMean of pred_lm: 0.0354\n95% PI of pred_lm: (-0.0483, 0.1073)\nTrue value of pct_enroll_yoy: 0.1796\nPredicted Number of Students: 3751\n95% PI of Number of Students: (3448, 4012)\nTrue Number of Students: 4392\n\n\nWe once again see a shrunken PI interval for this class. However, because the true percent change in percent enrollment was a large anomaly, our newly shrunken 95% PI does not capture our true percent change in percent share of enrollment. Nonetheless, the 95% PI can still be of practical use as it is not too far off from the true number of predicted students."

Viewing the revenue splits by hotel types, generally the city hotel generates more revenue throughout the year. The resort hotel appears to have large spikes in revenue during the holiday season (December-January). In general, revenue for TA-MU Hotels appears to be gradually increasing over time.\nWhile the city hotel generally brings in the most revenue per day, Figure 3.2 shows that the resort hotel during peak times has more money generated per guest.

Figure 3.3 breaks down the average amount of money spent per night by the length of stay for each booking.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Box plot of average amount of revenue spent per night stay.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 3.3, we see that there is no major difference between the average amount of money spent per night by the length of stay. Customers who only stay one night spend about the same on average per night as those who stay three nights. This result is again seen in Figure 3.4 when we take at each hotel’s average customer expenditure per night.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Box plot of average amount of revenue spent per night stay by each hotel."

Table 3.1 goes into more detail by looking into specific demographic details and the percent of bookings each demographic represents.\n\n\nTable 3.1: Client Demographics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHotel\nNumber of Adults\nKids in Booking\nCustomer Type\n% Bookings\n\n\n\n\nCity Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient\n33%\n\n\nResort Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient\n18%\n\n\nCity Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient-Party\n10%\n\n\nCity Hotel\n1\nNo\nTransient\n9%\n\n\nResort Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient-Party\n4%\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1 shows the top five demographics based on percent of bookings.

Both the city hotel and resort hotel have this demographic as their most popular client demographic, with over 50% of total company bookings from this demographic alone. Additionally, in 3rd and 5th place respectively are two adult parties as well but of transient party (booked with a connection to at least one other transient booking)."

Lost revenue primarily comes from canceled bookings. We see in Figure 3.6 that the city hotel, while generating the most bookings overall, also has a larger proportion of canceled bookings than the resort hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Bar plot of number of not-canceled/canceled bookings broken up by hotel type.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to quantify the impact of these cancelations, Figure 3.7 shows the daily gain of non-canceled bookings vs the daily loss of canceled bookings for each hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Top panel shows time series plot of daily revenue gained vs daily revenue lost based on non-canceled/canceled bookings in city hotel. Bottom panel shows time series plot of daily revenue gained vs daily revenue lost based on non-canceled/canceled bookings in resort hotel.\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see in Figure 3.7, the city hotel has quite a few times where lost revenue overtakes revenue gained. Several times we see large spikes in canceled bookings and subsequently large spikes in lost revenue. In contrast, it appears the resort hotel rarely has any days where lost revenue overtakes revenue gained. To further dive into the details of all this lost revenue, we can view Table 3.2 to see how many cancelations occur from our top five client demographics.\n\n\nTable 3.2: Client Demographics w/ Cancelations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHotel\nNumber of Adults\nKids in Booking\nCustomer Type\n% Bookings\n% Bookings Canceled\n\n\n\n\nCity Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient\n33%\n48%\n\n\nResort Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient\n18%\n33%\n\n\nCity Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient-Party\n10%\n32%\n\n\nCity Hotel\n1\nNo\nTransient\n9%\n42%\n\n\nResort Hotel\n2\nNo\nTransient-Party\n4%\n22%\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2 reveals a troubling finding for our top five client demographics. Our number one demographic currently has canceled about 48% of bookings! Our number two demographic, of the same type but at the resort hotel, also boasts a very high 33% canceled bookings. Identifying the reasons behind these cancelations are paramount in helping TA-MU Hotels increase their profitability."

To further dive into the details of the relationship between canceled bookings and lead time, Figure 3.9 shows the average lead time broken down by how the booking was created (through what marketing channel) split by hotel type and booking status.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Bar plot of average lead time split by hotel type, distribution channel, and booking status.\n\n\n\n\nThe barplots marked with 0s are bookings that were non-canceled and the barplots with 1s are bookings that were canceled (ie (City Hotel, 0) is average lead time for bookings that were not canceled). As we can see there are still large discrepancies between not canceled and canceled bookings, especially for the city hotel. The TA/TO distribution channel appears to generate the largest lead times for canceled bookings in both the city hotel and the resort hotel."

Additionally, we create dummy variable columns in order to account for factors in our model (i.e. distribution channel). The result of our data cleaning and feature engineering is a change from raw data of 119390 rows of data and 37 columns to training data of 61024 rows and 24 columns of data.\nTo help our model more accurately predict cancelations, we use a standard scaler to standardize each column of data. This will help the model recognize each feature as a normally distributed variable. Furthermore, to help determine the predictive capability of our model, we use a train-test split of 75% training and 25% test data.

To test this theory, we compared a logistic regression model with these 11 features against a logistic regression model with all 24 features. The results show that the models performed equally as well at predictive accuracy (both around 75%). We determine that using less features is more computationally efficient for similar predictive accuracy so we will use the 11 features that we found with the forward stepwise selection for the remainder of the iterative process of building a predictive model.\n\nAdditional Features\nAs noted previously in the report, there could be interactions between some of these features. For example, the effect that lead time has on the probability of a cancelation might change based on the kind of distribution channel the lead came from. Therefore, we will add two extra features to current subset of 11 features for our predictive model: interaction between distribution channel and lead time, and interaction between distribution channel and hotel type."

Conversely, x2, x4, x5, and x13 (stays in weekend nights, previous bookings not canceled, booking changes, and interaction between distribution channel TA/TO and hotel type) show a decrease in the log-odds of a cancelation.\nUsing this fitted logistic regression model, we can generate predictions and see how the model does at predicting cancelations using our test data. One metric to test the predictive capability of a classification type model is using a ROC curve and computing the AUC score from it. Figure 5.1 shows the corresponding ROC curve and AUC score.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: ROC curve for logistic regression model.\n\n\n\n\nThe ROC curve in Figure 5.1 shows that the model achieves an AUC score of about .82, indicating that the model does a pretty good job at distinguishing between a canceled booking and a non-canceled booking. Using this graph, we can extract the optimal threshold that minimizes our false positive rate while still achieveing a max true positive rate. Using this threshold, we can construct a confusion matrix to gain further inference on how the model performs on discovering cancelations. Figure 5.2 shows the resulting confusion matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Confusion matrix for logistic regression model.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the confusion matrix, we see that the logistic regression model does a very good job at identifying non-canceled bookings, but does not perform as well at identifying canceled bookings. However, while the performance does drop significantly between canceled and non-canceled booking classification, the majority of the time the model does predict the correct label for canceled bookings. To view more specific metrics from the confusion table, we can view Table 5.1.\n\n\nTable 5.1: Logistic Regression Metrics\n\n\nMetric Name\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n75%\n\n\nSensitivity\n55%\n\n\nSpecificity\n89%\n\n\nPPV\n80%\n\n\nNPV\n72%\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 5.1, we see that our logistic regression model performed well in every category except sensitivity. Even then, the sensitivity score is an acceptable one since the majority of the time it correctly labels a cancelation.\n\n\nRandom Forest\nWe now compare a tree based method approach to logistic regression by using a random forest. As we performed above, we will fit a random forest with the same training data and gather predictive metrics (AUC score, confusion matrix metrics) by using the same test set as the logistic regression model. Figure 5.3 shows the ROC curve and corresponding AUC score for the random forest model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: ROC curve and AUC score for random forest model.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 5.3, we see that the random forest model yielded a worse AUC score than the logistic regression model. We will check the resulting confusion matrix metrics for further comparison. Figure 5.4 contains the confusion matrix and Table 5.2 shows the resulting metrics from the confusion matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Confusion matrix for random forest model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Random Forest Model vs Logistic Regression Model\n\n\n\n\n(a) Random Forest Metrics\n\n\nMetric Name\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n75%\n\n\nSensitivity\n60%\n\n\nSpecificity\n86%\n\n\nPPV\n76%\n\n\nNPV\n74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Logistic Regression Metrics\n\n\nMetric Name\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n75%\n\n\nSensitivity\n55%\n\n\nSpecificity\n89%\n\n\nPPV\n80%\n\n\nNPV\n72%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 5.2 (a) and comparing these values to Table 5.2 (b), the random forest model performed very similarily to the logistic regression model. The random forest model achieved a higher sensitivity score while dropping in the specificity score. Additionally, the random forest model dropped in PPV but gained in NPV.\n\n\nXGBoost\nSince the random forest model did not appear to beat out the performance of the logistic regression model, we will now perform a comparison between XGBoost classification and the logistic regression model. We will perform the same procedures as done with the logistic regression model and the random forest model. Figure 5.5 shows the resulting ROC curve and corresponding AUC score.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: ROC curve and AUC score for XGBoost model\n\n\n\n\nThe AUC score for the XGBoost model appears to be very similar to the random forest model, and consequently is much lower than the logistic regression model AUC. Figure 5.6 and Table 5.3 show the resulting confusion matrix and corresponding metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Confusion matrix for XGBoost model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: XGBoost vs Logistic Regression Model\n\n\n\n\n(a) XGBoost Metrics\n\n\nMetric Name\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n75%\n\n\nSensitivity\n50%\n\n\nSpecificity\n95%\n\n\nPPV\n88%\n\n\nNPV\n71%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Logistic Regression Metrics\n\n\nMetric Name\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n75%\n\n\nSensitivity\n55%\n\n\nSpecificity\n89%\n\n\nPPV\n80%\n\n\nNPV\n72%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 5.3, we see that XGBoost improves in specificity over the logistic regression model, but decreases at almost the same degree in sensitivity. There is also a large jump in PPV and a slight decline in NPV for XGBoost over logistic regression.\n\n\nBayesian Logistic Regression\nThus far we have attempted to compare the logistic regression model to more ensemble-esque methods. We now attempt to demonstrate a different approach to the logistic regression model by incorporating priors on each feature. That is, we will perform a bayesian logistic regression to compare to the normal logistic regression method.\nDue to our limited subject matter expertise in the hotel industry, we will use uninformative priors for each feature. We will assume that each feature is drawn from a normal distribution with mean = \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation = \\(\\sigma\\). For each \\(\\mu\\), we will place a prior of a normal distribution with \\(\\mu\\) = 0 and \\(\\sigma\\) = 2. For each \\(\\sigma\\), we will place a prior of a inverse gamma distribution with \\(\\alpha\\) = 1 and \\(\\beta\\) = 1.\nFor our sampler, we will use a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Energy Conserving Sampling. This is chosen due to the size of our dataset and the lack of sufficient computational power to perform a more precise sampling with sampler such as the No-U Turn sampler. After fitting our bayesian logistic regression model, we obtain the following results in Figure 5.7.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Posterior distributions for each feature.\n\n\n\n\nA benefit of performing a bayesian model is the viewable uncertainty around parameters of interest. In our case, we can see the distributions of each beta value from our model. For example, the change in log-odds on booking status by lead time is likely to be around .7, but can be anywhere between .65 and .75, according to our model. Additionally, our predictions can also have this kind of uncertainty around them. For example, below is information pertaining to a booking that ended up canceling.\n\n\nlead_time                         110.0\nstays_in_weekend_nights             0.0\nprevious_cancellations              0.0\nprevious_bookings_not_canceled      0.0\nbooking_changes                     0.0\nrequired_car_parking_spaces         0.0\ndistribution_channel_TA/TO          1.0\nreserved_room_type_E                0.0\ndeposit_type_Non Refund             0.0\ndeposit_type_Refundable             0.0\nhotel_Resort Hotel                  0.0\nName: 10000, dtype: float64\n\n\nWe see that there were 110 days between lead entered into system and arrival date, that they were staying in the city hotel (hotel_resort = 0) and that they booked throuh TA/TO. Using our bayesian model, we can view the uncertainty around this prediction, as shown in Figure 5.8.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Posterior Predictive Distribution for the described canceled booking.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 5.8, we see that the most likely value from the distribution is around .42 to .43. According to the distribution, the probability that somebody with this kind of booking information (from our primary demographic) cancels is around .41 to .44.\nWhile the world of bayesian modeling is fascinating and can be powerful, the goal remains the same of providing a model that could be of use to us in identifying where we need to double book rooms in order to maximize profit for TA-MU Hotels. Just like in the other sections, we will compare the AUC score and derived confusion matrix metrics. Figure 5.9 shows the ROC curve for our bayesian model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: ROC curve and corresponding AUC score for bayesian logistic regression model.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 5.9, we see that the AUC score is very similar to the original logistic regression model. Figure 5.10 shows the corresponding confusion matrix and Table 5.4 show the comparison between the bayesian logistic regression model and the regular logistic regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Confusion matrix for bayesian logistic regression model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: Bayesian Logistic Regression Model vs Logistic Regression Model\n\n\n\n\n(a) Bayesian Logistic Regression Metrics\n\n\nMetric Name\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n75%\n\n\nSensitivity\n53%\n\n\nSpecificity\n92%\n\n\nPPV\n84%\n\n\nNPV\n72%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Logistic Regression Metrics\n\n\nMetric Name\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n75%\n\n\nSensitivity\n55%\n\n\nSpecificity\n89%\n\n\nPPV\n80%\n\n\nNPV\n72%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 5.4, we see that the two models are very similar. The bayesian model shows a slight increase in specificity and a small decrease in sensitivity. The bayesian model also shows an increase in PPV while keeping NPV the same as the regular logistic regression model."

To decide which logistic regression model to use, we look at the confusion matrix metrics and AUC scores. Both models have similar confusion matrix metrics and AUC scores. However, the bayesian logistic regression model has a particular advantage over the regular logistic regression model due to its inherit ability at including uncertainty around parameter estimates and predictions. Therefore, we recommend that we continue with the bayesian logistic regression model as our initial cancelation predictive model.\nThe full model for our bayesian logistic regression model is shown in Equation 5.1\n\\[\n\\text{log}(\\frac{p(Y)}{1-p(Y)}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 ... + \\beta_{m}x_m\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Y}_1 ... \\text{Y}_n \\overset{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} \\text{Bernoulli}(p)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu \\sim N(0, 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma \\sim IG(1, 1)\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\nEquation 5.1 states that the log-odds of booking status (1 being cancelation and 0 being non-cancelation) is a linear function of \\(m\\) predictors (our 11 features and two interaction terms) weighted by \\(m+1\\) betas (13 for the features and one intercept beta). Our response variable \\(Y\\) is a collection of n number of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with probability \\(p\\). Our betas are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). All \\(\\mu\\) values have a normal prior distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 2. All \\(\\sigma\\) values have an inverse gamma prior distribution with shape = 1 and scale = 1."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn this post, we provide an implementation for the paper Uplift Modeling for Multiple Treatments with Cost Optimization [1]. We provide this implementation in the context of a marketing department testing which marketing campaign is most effective for a given loyalty tier. We continue with this example by extending the uplift framework to non-compliance situations. In this, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal Forests [2] in calculating conditional local average treatment effects (C-LATE). The full code for this implementation can be found at the github repo.\n\n\nIntroduction\nUplift modeling is a useful way of measuring the incremental impact of treatments compared to the control. Essentially, it measures how an individual will react to interventions. Equation 2.1 shows the math behind the calculation.\n\\[\n\\text{Uplift}_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nEquation 2.1 utilizes the potential outcomes framework derived by Rubin in [3]. Since we can only ever observe the effects of treatment or control on an individual, the average treatment effect (ATE) Equation 2.2 is the usual metric calculated to understand treatment impact in an experiment. Furthermore, to understand how the treatment effect changes amongst subgroups/subpopulations, the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) Equation 2.3 is useful in identifying the heterogeneous treatment effect.\n\\[\n\\tau = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\n\\[\n\\tau(x_i) = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X]\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nIn the context of marketing, the CATE is of great interest since it helps marketing organizations identify how treatments fair with different customer segments. For example, a marketing team might run a A/B test with some customers receiving a special promo (treatment) while others receive nothing (control) to see if there is a change in purchase behavior.\nUplift modeling follows the same basic assumptions of most causal inference models, namely: stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), unconfoundness, and overlap. SUTVA means that there is no interference between treatment assignments and potential outcomes of individuals, as well as no unaccounted treatment versions in the study. Unconfoundness means the treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes after conditioning on observed covariates (X) (see Equation 2.4). Overlap means that for every observed combination of covariates (X) in the data, there is a non-zero probability of being assigned to either treatment or control.\n\\[\n\\{Y(1), Y(0)\\} \\perp T \\mid X\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\n\n\nProblem Formulation\nWe pose the situation of a bakery business looking to increase ticket sizes via promotional campaigns. The bakery business is fairly simple with the following price-cost structure (see Table 3.1).\n\n\nTable 3.1: Bakery Price-Cost Structure\n\n\nItems\nPrice\nCost\n\n\n\n\nDonut\n$2.50\n$1.00\n\n\nPastry\n$3.00\n$1.50\n\n\nSandwich\n$4.50\n$2.00\n\n\nCoffee\n$1.00\n$0.20\n\n\nJuice\n$1.50\n$0.50\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the business runs a loyalty program that is four-tiered with levels: none, bronze, silver, gold. Each tier repeats purchases at a different rate (from the synthetic data, this is defined as a Poisson r.v.). Furthermore, customers are not willing to go and purchase things from our bakery if they are too far away. We define the distance from the bakery as the time when promotions are sent out to customers (for those who receive no promotions, it is still marked at the same time as promotion receivers). Lastly, we assume that the company’s promotions have an effect on the ticket size of an individual transaction. Figure 3.1 illustrates our assumed flow of causality for this situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Proposed DAG for our experiment on increasing individual transaction ticket size.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Figure 3.1 shows the flow of causality going through the number of items purchased to determine ticket size, we will focus our analysis and modeling on the ticket size and will ignore this step of the DAG. This is to more easily calculate Net Value of the transaction, where we will define this as \\(NV = R - MC\\), where \\(NV\\) is net value, \\(R\\) is revenue, and \\(MC\\) is marketing costs. From this, we propose that the optimal treatment program (i.e. optimal policy) can be defined in Equation 3.1.\n\\[\\pi^* \\in \\underset{\\pi}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\{V(\\pi)\\} , \\quad \\pi^*(x) = \\mathbf{1} (\\{\\tau(x) &gt; 0\\}) \\tag{3.1}\\]\nEquation 3.1 states that the optimal policy \\(\\pi\\) is that which maximizes the some arbitrary value function \\(V(\\pi)\\). Although the above question is generally for single treatment experiments, it can be extended to multiple treatments.\nSpecifically, the business wants to experiment with 3 different treatments: free donut, free juice, and a 30% discount. Furthermore, they wish to know through which marketing channel is the treatment most effective, namely: social media, in-app notifications, and email. Therefore, we have 9 distinct treatments that we need to test against the control (i.e. receiving no promotion).\nAssummptions: We list here some crucial assumptions for this analysis demonstration. First, we operate under the 3 assumptions stated above (SUTVA, unconfoundness, and overlap). Second, we operate under the assumption that there is no spill over effect amongst participants. Though this is not an exhaustive list of assumptions from this experiment, these are sufficient for the educational purposes of this post.\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe begin our analysis by illustrating the average number of items purchased daily segmented by customer loyalty tier. Figure 4.1 shows such distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Average # of items purchased per day segmented by customer loyalty status.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1 shows that on average, our none tier customers don’t purchase anything, bronze tier is around 1 item, silver tier around 2 items, and gold tier around 4. This is expected as we suppose that as loyalty increases so does amount purchased daily.\nWithin the experiment itself, we aimed to have 50% of customers be part of the control group with the other 50% in treatment split amongst the 9 treatmentes. The dataset below shows the splits in treatments.\n\n\nmarketing_channel  marketing_treatment\nemail              discount                222\n                   free_donut              212\n                   free_juice              225\nin-app             discount                211\n                   free_donut              208\n                   free_juice              222\nnone               none                   2047\nsocial             discount                213\n                   free_donut              204\n                   free_juice              236\nName: user_id, dtype: int64\n\n\nThe total observations in the dataset is 4000. Each treatment received around 200 customers and the control sat around 2000.\nTo get a good idea on whether the treatments had an impact or not, we can look at Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Average ticket between control and treated customers.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2 clearly shows an increase in the average ticket size of treated customers. While we don’t know for sure if the difference is statistically significant, it is comforting to see that from the data, there is approximately a 50 cent difference. We can further view the effects of treatments by segmenting by tier and viewing the respective changes in ticket size based on the treatments received. This is shown in Figure 4.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Average ticket size for each treatment, broken down by customer loyalty tier.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3 tells an even better story than Figure 4.2. Here, we see that each loyalty tier had different responses to the treatments. The none tier customers had a huge spike in average ticket size when treated via social media with the 30% discount. Bronze tier customers seemed to favor the free donut the most via the app. Silver tier enjoyed any promotion via the app. Gold tier is a bit harder to identify due to the amount of variation in their data, but free donuts appear to be the most impactful for ticket size.\nWhile the increase in revenue is an important start in the uplift analysis, we need to remember we are optimizing for Net Value. Thus, we need to include the costs associated with sending these promotions. Figure 4.4 shows this change.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Average net value for each treatment, broken down by customer loyalty tier.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4 shows how the costs of marketing affected each treatment, but especially the discount ones. A 30% discount is a hefty price to pay for our business so if we can avoid such a heavy cost by finding treatments that cost less but are just as effective, that would be great. The results appear to hold from Figure 4.3.\n\n\nUplift Modeling\nAs mentioned in the introduction, uplift modeling estimates how a customer will react to interventions. There are many ways to estimate the uplift of a treatment. In this section, we implement a x-learner [4]. The x-learner belongs to a family of algorithms called meta-learners that specialize in utilizing machine learning approaches like random forests or boosting methods to estimate causal effects. While the x-learner was originally designed for binary treatments, [1] demonstrates a way to extend the framework to multiple treatments. The stages of implementing the x-learner are shown below.\n\\[\n\\mu_{t_{j}} = E[Y(t_{j})|X=x]\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\n\\[\nD^{t_{0}}_{i} = \\hat{\\mu}_{t_{j}}(x) - Y_{i}\n\\] \\[\nD^{t_{j}}_{i} = Y_{i} - \\hat{\\mu}_{t_{0}}(x)\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau}^{t_{j}}(x) = \\frac{\\hat{e}_{t_{j}}(x)}{\\hat{e}_{t_{j}}(x) + \\hat{e}_{t_{0}}(x)}\\hat{\\tau}_{t_{0}}(x) + \\frac{\\hat{e}_{t_{0}}(x)}{\\hat{e}_{t_{j}}(x) + \\hat{e}_{t_{0}}(x)}\\hat{\\tau}_{t_{j}}(x)\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\nThe first stage of the x-learner is just normal regression. We fit any regression type model to model the outcomes of \\(Y\\) on covariates \\(X\\) for each treatment \\(t\\). The second stage of the x-learner is where we impute the treatment effect \\(D\\) by using the fitted regression models from Equation 5.1. This is essentially calculating counterfactual outcomes such that we can estimate individual treatment effects (ITEs). This is once again done for each treatment \\(t\\). We then “repeat” the process as before and create regression models that regress the treatment effects (or more properly, pseudo-effects) on the covariates \\(X\\) to obtain functions \\(\\hat{\\tau}_{t_{0}}\\) for the control and \\(\\hat{\\tau}_{t_{j}}\\) for the j-th treatment. The third stage utilizes the propensity scores for each treatment to adjust the “weights” of each treatment. These weights adjust the outputs from the models generated from Equation 5.2 to obtain our CATE for each treatment \\(j\\).\nTo train our x-learner, we use the causalML library. We use an 80-20 split on 4000 observations (~2000 control vs ~2000 treated, split among 9 treatments). The base learner for our x-learner is a gradient boosting regressor from sklearn.\nWhile understanding the CATE due to all features in the dataset, for this business case specifically, understanding the CATE for each tier is of great importance. An understanding of what promotion is most effective with each tier is crucical for marketing strategy optimization. Below we output the CATE values for those in the none tier.\n\n\narray([-0.50800717, -0.33919301, -0.48013309, -0.16522906, -0.2352354 ,\n       -0.09895951,  1.14556021, -0.28385185, -0.26179227])\n\n\n\n\n{'email-discount': 0,\n 'email-free_donut': 1,\n 'email-free_juice': 2,\n 'in-app-discount': 3,\n 'in-app-free_donut': 4,\n 'in-app-free_juice': 5,\n 'social-discount': 6,\n 'social-free_donut': 7,\n 'social-free_juice': 8}\n\n\nUtilizing the mapping dictionary above, we see that most of our promotions on average perform no better (or actually worse) than the control, with the exception to one. The social discount promotion shows that it adds an additional 1.15 to our net value, on average. Due to the synthetic nature of our data, we are pleased with this result as the x-learner correctly identified the one promotion that we set to have an influence on purchasing behavior for those in the none loyalty tier. In a real business case, we’d want to further validate these estimates by doing a variety of checks (e.g. confidence intervals, AUUC, sensitivity checks, etc.). For the purpose of this post, it suffices us to see that the x-learner identified the hidden causal mechanism in the data.\n\n\nUplift Modeling with Non Compliance\nFor the purposes of business strategy in understanding which promotions worked best, our above approach and results would suffice. We identified with our x-learner which promotions cause a higher ticket size for different tiered customers. We can present these suggestions to our marketing team and away they go at promoting the business more effectively. However, from the lens of causal inference data scientists, we know these estimates are biased. Not everyone we sent our promotions to went to the store to make a purchase. This means that not everyone who was treated acted upon the treatment we provided. This suggests that we have non compliance within our study.\nNon compliance gets its name from biostatistic experiments where researchers would assign treatments to individuals but those individuals would not comply with the directive. This is exactly what is happening in our study. Not everyone who was treated with a promotion went to the store to make a purchase. Figure 6.1 shows exactly this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Scatterplot of net value by distance to store colored by treatment.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that anyone who was more than 2.75 miles from the store did not make a purchase, regardless of treatment. However, we assumed in the beginning that those who were in the control could not receive promotional effects (i.e. control can’t non comply). Therefore, we are only dealing with non complianace via treated -&gt; control. From this perspective, while we did calculate a CATE, we did so estimating the intent to treat (ITT). This is the causal effect of treatment assignment, not of the treatment itself. To calculate the causal effect of the treatment, we need to accounnt for non compliance.\nIn order to account for non compliance within our study, we can utilize a popular approach of implementing an instrument variable (IV). IVs help reintroduce randomization into our study to help isolate the causal variation in our treatments. A IV needs to meet three assumptions. First, the IV must be correlated with the treatment (Relevance). Second, the IV must affect the outcome only through the treatment (Exclusion). Third, the IV must be independent of unmeasured confounders that affect the treatment and outcome (Exogeneity). In our case, we can simply add the instrument Promotion Offered to be our IV since it matches these assumptions. Figure 6.2 illustrates our new flow of causality.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Proposed DAG for addressing non compliance in our study.\n\n\n\n\nOur updated DAG in Figure 6.2 shows how this new knowledge of non compliance affects how we model causality. Because we know that distance to store affects whether or not a customer goes to the store, it now has causal edges to promotion redeemed and ticket size. Additionally, from our EDA we noticed that different tiers purchase at different rates so tier still affects ticket size directly. As well, different tiers value different promotions so it has an effect on whether the promotion is redeemed or not. Lastly, we included our IV in promotion offered. Promotion offered is not affected by other confounders, only affects the outcome of net value through promotion redeemed, and is clearly correlated with promotion redeemed.\nTo model our new approach, we utilize causal IV forests from [2]. Causal forests build off the foundations of random forests. It utilizes n number of decision trees to calculate the average result. The causality comes from estimating the counterfactual outcomes, just as we saw with the x-learner above. To perform this, the splitting criterion focuses on the variation in treatment effect. A short summary of the algorithm is provided below.\n\nFor a given tree, randomly sample data with replacement and split into split and estimation set.\nFor a given node in a tree, iterate through features and cut points.\nIdentify the split that maximizes the variance-based criterion such that heterogeneity is maximized.\nFor a fully grown tree, for each terminal node, estimate CATE.\nAverage CATE across all trees.\n\nFor a more thorough explanation of the algorithm, see [2]. The algorithm is then adapted to our scenario where we utilize IVs. In this case, the algorithm becomes generalized to incorporate \\(Z\\), our indicator variable of whether or not a customer was assigned a promotion or not. The algorithm then adjusts for this by estimating the local conditional average treatment effect (L-CATE).\nOur causalIVforest is implemented using econML. Similar to above, we use a 80-20 split. We do not perform any hyperparameter tuning for the causalIVforest. We output the split of tiers in our test set below.\n\n\nloyalty_tier_none      309\nloyalty_tier_bronze    264\nloyalty_tier_silver    161\nloyalty_tier_gold       66\ndtype: int64\n\n\nAfter fitting our data, we test the model on the above sample and yield the following results shown in Figure 6.3. We also output the explicit effects for each treatment in the none loyalty tier below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: C-LATE for each tier, treatment combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\narray([-4.0571709 , -1.68161069, -4.44325053, -1.15262721, -2.26189429,\n       -0.27730894,  0.92089754, -0.57709819, -1.58279785])\n\n\nFigure 6.3 looks very similar to Figure 4.4, but with an important distinction. Figure 4.4 were the average net values in the raw data. Figure 6.3 shows the treatment effects for each treatment for each tier. Looking at the none tier graph and numeric output, we see that all treatments yield a negative treatment effect with the exception to social-discount. This makes sense since from our synthetic data, none of the other treatments should have yieled a change in consumer behavior. Thus, when accounting for the costs of marketing, these other treatments cause a negative effect in net value. Conversely, since social-discount yields a +1 increase to purchase behavior, it shows a positive increase in net value. This pattern continues throughout all the tiers.\nThe important distinction to make from this output and that of the x-learner is what the story behind each metric is. For the x-learner, we estimated the conditional intent to treat (CITT) effect, showing how assignment of the treatment causes changes in customer behavior. For the causalIVforest, we estimated the conditional local average treatment effect (C-LATE), showing how the redemption of the promotion causes changes in customer behavior. One estimates with everyone regardless of if they redeemed or not and the other estimates only for those who would redeem.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this post, we posed a business problem of understanding the effects of our promotions on customer purchase behavior. We demonstrated two causal inference methods using machine learning: the x-learner and the causalIVforest. The x-learner was used to estimate CATE/CITT so that our business could understand the effects of assignment of promotion on our customers, specifically the different loyalty tiers. The causalIVforest was used to estimate C-LATE so that our business could more precisely understand the effects of redemption of promotion in customer behavior. Overall, we hope that this post was a good demonstration on the usefulness of causal inference in business situations and how one can utilize Python packages to carry out an informative analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Z.

    "text": "TL;DR\nThis blog focuses on the use of statistics, particularly bayesian statistics, in the application of business problems. In this post, we review the necessary math background in order to understand future blog posts. As well, we establish expectations for future blog posts and the order in which they are shared.\n\n\nWelcome To My Blog!\nWelcome to my blog! If you are reading this, I hope that means you are as excited about learning statistics as I am about teaching it (and continuing to learn it!). This blog, honestly, is mostly a tool for me to improve my own knowledge in statistics by learning how I would convey it to others. I plan on doing this from a data analysis perspective. Given a certain situation/set of data points, how do we construct the problems we want to solve and implement proper solutions. Particularly, I hope to demonstrate that Bayesian methods can be viable methods to solve problems in business, healthcare, etc. Anyways, I hope you find this blog interesting and useful in your data career. Whether you are just entering data or are an experienced data professional, this blog intends to be a resource in demonstrating good data analysis with sound applied mathematical theory.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nWhile I did mention above that this blog is intended to be useful for beginners and experts alike, I will admit that I will be covering some higher level math, such as:\n\n\nMultivariate Calculus\n\n\nProbability Theory\n\n\nLinear Algebra\n\n\nFor example, suppose we are studying a dataset with a variable that is modeled as an exponential random variable, we would use the below notation to show the probability density function (PDF)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda e^{\\lambda x} \\,dx\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nX \\sim Exponential(\\lambda)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nOr, the important Bayes Theorem found below.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nDon’t be discourage if the above formulas don’t make sense right now. In each post that these appear, I will breakdown what they mean and their applicability in solving our problem.\n\n\nExpectations\nThe hope of this blog is to present statistics in the form of a data analysis case. For example, let’s say you are a host on AirBnB and want to maximize the number of nights you rent out. How do you properly price your rental given certain parameters (size, geographic setting, etc). We would then present the data points and walk through an analysis of the data by doing the following.\n\n\nExploring the data (EDA) to get to know our dataset\n\n\nConstructing a mathematical framework that can fit our data\n\n\nFit our data to said framework\n\n\nGather inference from our model\n\n\nReview answers explained by our model\n\n\nExplain possible enhancements to our model for future analyses\n\n\nThis will be our attempted framework to blog posts. I hope that by tackling problems in this way, our analytical toolbox will grow and our ability to construct measurable problems from our data will improve. This is the ultimate goal of this blog. I really hope that people will recognize this blog as an opportunity to learn how to think analytically.\n\n\nLet’s do this\nI just want to reiterate that I am excited to learn how to be a better analyst with you by getting to know the math that drives our analytics. I am very passionate about how data can be used to properly drive decision-making in organizations and I hope that this blog motivates you to do the same."
